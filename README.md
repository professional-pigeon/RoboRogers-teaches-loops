## Description

This is a practice in loops and arrays and ends up being deceptively simple. It takes numbers, turns them into a range, and replaces numbers in that range with the automated beeps and boops of a robot along with catchphrase of Mr. Rogers.

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs

## Future plans

* includes() is string or array protoype. It can't take numbers. I was able to turn a number array into a string array and then manipulate the string how I wanted. I would love to know if there's a way to use an "includes" style method on a numerical value as I was not able to implement one in an efficient way. Reach out if you have a suggestion.
